# Covid_Cases_US_Final_Application
A shiny app  was created for visualizing covid cases and death's in the United States for the year of 2020

This includes a map of the US with amount of cases/deaths for each state

The bar plot was used to show the trend of daily cases and deaths 

The data was extracted from CDC official website. This dashboard is made along with my colleague Aarush Sood.

**To Run the app, follow these steps:**

Step 1: Download the data folder containing all of the following csv files; "case_daily_trends_united_states", "death_daily_trends_united_states", "united_states_covid19_cases_and_deaths_by_state"

Step 2: Please also download .json file; "gz_2010_us_040_00_500k" which is essential to create our US maps that show covid cases and deaths

Step 3: Download the file; "Vishal_sood_app_final" which contains the code for our shiny app to run the application

Step 4: Download the R project; "Vishal_Sood_finalproject"

Step 5: Open the R project (Vishal_Sood_finalproject) first and our R shiny app (Vishal_sood_app_final) after opening the project

Step 6: Hit run app

Note: You main folder shoud contain these following 4 files/folders: 1) .json (file) 2) R code (file) 3) R project (file) 4) Data (folder) which contains 3 csv files

Note 2: if you are downloading this as a zip folder: after extracting you might have to save this folder outside of a downloaded zip folder.
